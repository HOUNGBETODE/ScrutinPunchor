The abusive use of internet and IT tools has led to a proliferation of cyberattacks, which now target digital infrastructures, businesses as well as individual users without any distinctions. 

Faced with this growing threat, the whole IT community has developed an arsenal of solutions and countermeasures aimed at preventing, detecting and mitigating the impact of these attacks.

ScrutinPunchor, the fruit of our research, is a proactive monitoring tool designed to reinforce IT security and contribute to that cyber battle. It's main goal resides in detecting and somehow preventing intrusions into file systems. It offers dual protection by operating in
two complementary modes: `GUARDIAN` mode and `WATCHER` one.

The `GUARDIAN` mode provides real-time monitoring of any event modifying a secure directory, alerting the user and enabling prompt intervention whereas the `WATCHER` actively analyzes newly created and updated files using three detection engines (VirusTotal, MalwareHashRegistry and QuickSand) to check wether they are safe or not and by the way, reveal the presence of malware.

In this way, ScrutinPunchor positions itself as a leading tool in the cybersecurity landscape, helping to strengthen the resilience of information systems.
